# QueryingDatabases_UsingSELECTStatements
Project Objectives
In this project, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

-Retrieve data from tables of a database using SQL SELECT statement.
-Use different SQL operators together with the WHERE clause to set conditions on tables of a database for database manipulation,

By the end of this project, you will be able to use SQL SELECT statement to query a database for database insights. 

**Project Structure**
This project on Querying databases using SQL SELECT statement is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: SELECT - FROM
SQL SELECT statement basics
Retrieve all data from the employees, departments, employees and salaries tables

Task 2: SELECT - FROM AND WHERE
SELECT data FROM a table
SELECT data FROM a table by setting conditions using the WHERE clause

Task 3: SQL Operators
SELECT data FROM a table using AND with the WHERE clause
SELECT data FROM a table using OR with the WHERE clause
SELECT data FROM a table taking note of operator precedence
SELECT data FROM a table using IN & NOT IN with the WHERE clause

Task 4: Wildcard Characters
SELECT data FROM a table using LIKE & NOT LIKE with (%) in the WHERE clause
SELECT data FROM a table using LIKE & NOT LIKE with (_) in the WHERE clause

Task 5: SQL Operators - Part 2
SELECT data FROM a table using BETWEEN - AND with the WHERE clause
SELECT data FROM a table using IS NULL & IS NOT NULL with the WHERE clause

Task 6: Other Comparison Operators
SELECT data FROM a table using equal to and not equal to in the WHERE clause
SELECT data FROM a table using greater than, greater than and equals to in the WHERE clause
SELECT data FROM a table using less than, less than and equals to in the WHERE clause

Task 7: SELECT DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and SQL Aliases    
SELECT DISTINCT data FROM a table
Sort the result set of a query using ORDER BY
Set LIMIT on the result set of a query
Give a temporary name to a column of a table
